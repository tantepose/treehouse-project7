### Treehouse Fullstack Javascript Techdegree, project #7: 
# "Build a Twitter Interface"

### by Ole Petter Baugerød Stokke

From the instructions:

>In this project, you'll use Twitter’s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page should automatically authenticate access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:
>
> * Your 5 most recent tweets.
> * Your 5 most recent friends.
> * Your 5 most recent private messages.
